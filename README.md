Project Idea: Community Safety Alert System

Problem:
In many communities, residents often feel unsafe or are unaware of local emergencies (like natural disasters or security threats). Quick communication can be vital in such situations.

Solution:
Develop a Community Safety Alert System that allows residents to report emergencies or safety issues and receive alerts.

Components Used:
•	Buzzer: To signal an alert.
•	Button: For residents to report an emergency.
•	LED: To visually indicate the status of the system (e.g., green for normal, red for alert).
•	Rotary Angle Sensor: To adjust the volume of alerts.
•	Potentiometer: To control the sensitivity of the emergency report button (e.g., preventing false alarms).
•	Screen: To display messages, alerts, and instructions.

How It Works:
1.	Emergency Reporting:
o	Residents can press the button to report an emergency (like a fire, suspicious activity, etc.).
o	The system uses the potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity, preventing accidental reports.
2.	Alert System:
o	When an emergency is reported, the LED turns red, and the buzzer sounds an alert, notifying other residents in the vicinity.
o	The screen displays the type of emergency and basic instructions (e.g., "Fire reported! Evacuate!" or "Suspicious activity reported! Stay indoors!").
3.	Volume Control:
o	The rotary angle sensor allows users to adjust the alert volume to suit their environment (quiet for residential areas, louder for public places).
4.	Community Connectivity:
o	Optionally, the system could be designed to connect to a community network (like a local Wi-Fi or a mesh network) to send notifications to nearby residents' mobile devices.
Demonstration:
•	Set up a prototype with the components arranged in a compact unit.
•	Simulate an emergency by pressing the button, triggering the buzzer and LED, and displaying a message on the screen.
•	Show how the volume can be adjusted with the rotary angle sensor.
