Project Idea: Community Safety Alert System

Problem:
In many communities, residents often feel unsafe or are unaware of local emergencies (like natural disasters or security threats). Quick communication can be vital in such situations.

Solution:
Develop a Community Safety Alert System that allows residents to report emergencies or safety issues and receive alerts.

Components Used:
•	Buzzer: To signal an alert.
•	Button: For residents to report an emergency.
•	LED: To visually indicate the status of the system (e.g., green for normal, red for alert).
•	Rotary Angle Sensor: To adjust the volume of alerts.
•	Potentiometer: To control the sensitivity of the emergency report button (e.g., preventing false alarms).
•	Screen: To display messages, alerts, and instructions.

Problem Overview

Problem we Hope to Solve

“Preventing collateral damage due to guided missiles and aerial strikes as a result of urban warfare.”
Due to the ongoing wars in eastern Europe between Ukraine and Russia and in Western Asia between Palestine and Israel the death toll of civilians being killed is rising with every day that passes. In this project we hope to design an early warning system to alert residents in urban areas of potential attacks that could be approaching. With the help of this alarm system, we hope to reduce the number of civilian casualties in these wars

Pravada, UP. (2024). ‘Russians killed and injured at least 1,400 civilians in September – UN’.
This report was published on the 18th of October 2024 and shows that there is a real problem for civilians living in active warzones in Ukraine.
“The main causes of civilian casualties were missile strikes across the country and the use of guided aerial bombs, particularly in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia.” This quote from this report shows how guided aerial bombs are killing civilians in their homes. In this report it states that 9 children lost their lives. 

One of the problems we cannot prevent is the lack of respect for civilian lives in the wars and with the public in the warzones worrying about potential attack 24/7. We cannot prevent this but with the help of this early alarm system we hope to make it safer for residence living in the urban areas to find shelter before the missiles land.
