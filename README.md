Project Idea: Community Safety Alert System

Problem:
In many communities, residents often feel unsafe or are unaware of local emergencies (like natural disasters or security threats). Quick communication can be vital in such situations.

Solution:
Develop a Community Safety Alert System that allows residents to report emergencies or safety issues and receive alerts.

Components Used:
•	Buzzer: To signal an alert.
•	Button: For residents to report an emergency.
•	LED: To visually indicate the status of the system (e.g., green for normal, red for alert).
•	Rotary Angle Sensor: To adjust the volume of alerts.
•	Potentiometer: To control the sensitivity of the emergency report button (e.g., preventing false alarms).
•	Screen: To display messages, alerts, and instructions.

How It Works:
1.	Emergency Reporting:
o	Residents can press the button to report an emergency (like a fire, suspicious activity, etc.).
o	The system uses the potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity, preventing accidental reports.
2.	Alert System:
o	When an emergency is reported, the LED turns red, and the buzzer sounds an alert, notifying other residents in the vicinity.
o	The screen displays the type of emergency and basic instructions (e.g., "Fire reported! Evacuate!" or "Suspicious activity reported! Stay indoors!").
3.	Volume Control:
o	The rotary angle sensor allows users to adjust the alert volume to suit their environment (quiet for residential areas, louder for public places).
4.	Community Connectivity:
o	Optionally, the system could be designed to connect to a community network (like a local Wi-Fi or a mesh network) to send notifications to nearby residents' mobile devices.
Demonstration:
•	Set up a prototype with the components arranged in a compact unit.
•	Simulate an emergency by pressing the button, triggering the buzzer and LED, and displaying a message on the screen.
•	Show how the volume can be adjusted with the rotary angle sensor.


Problem Overview
Problem we Hope to Solve
“Preventing collateral damage due to guided missiles and aerial strikes as a result of urban warfare.”
Due to the ongoing wars in eastern Europe between Ukraine and Russia and in Western Asia between Palestine and Israel the death toll of civilians being killed is rising with every day that passes. In this project we hope to design an early warning system to alert residents in urban areas of potential attacks that could be approaching. With the help of this alarm system, we hope to reduce the number of civilian casualties in these wars

Pravada, UP. (2024). ‘Russians killed and injured at least 1,400 civilians in September – UN’.
This report was published on the 18th of October 2024 and shows that there is a real problem for civilians living in active warzones in Ukraine.
“The main causes of civilian casualties were missile strikes across the country and the use of guided aerial bombs, particularly in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia.” This quote from this report shows how guided aerial bombs are killing civilians in their homes. In this report it states that 9 children lost their lives. 

One of the problems we cannot prevent is the lack of respect for civilian lives in the wars and with the public in the warzones worrying about potential attack 24/7. We cannot prevent this but with the help of this early alarm system we hope to make it safer for residence living in the urban areas to find shelter before the missiles land.
